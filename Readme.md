Hi, these are the instructions to use this app. It is really simple.

Follow these steps:
1. You can use Shift + p to increase size of the part or you can use Shift + m to decrease size of the part
2. Type the first letter of the body part you want to enter. So suppose... t for tail and b for body. Here are the letters and parts related to it:
t - tail
b - body
f - face
h - hair
n - necaklace
r - right hand
l - left hand

I have used princesses instead of superheroes:
Ariel's tail
Elsa's Body
Aurora's Face
Jasmine's Hair
Moana's Necklace
Belle's Right hand
Belle's Left hand

3. The part will appear on the top left corner.
4. You have to drag it tothe place you want to place it.
5. Adjust it accordingly

You can refer the sample output picture given in this repository.
